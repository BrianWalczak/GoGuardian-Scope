Hey there, you may be wondering what this is...
<br>
This is an exploit that allows you to inject JS on your school Chromebook
<br>
This is currently only available for users that have GoGuardian on their device
<br><br>
If you have Gopher Buddy on your device, stay updated as I am building an exploit for it soon!
